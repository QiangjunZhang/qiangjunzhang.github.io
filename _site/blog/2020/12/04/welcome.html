    <p>In this special year, when we are all stuck at home during Coronavirus lockdown,
I finally made my mind, and decided to pursue a career as a software engineer.</p>

<p>It is not an easy decision for me.
After spent so many years in academia and earned a PhD in engineering,
everyone thought I will stay in academia and find a job in an University somewhere.
No doubt, it was difficult to explain to my friends why I made this decision,
actually many of them were shocked.</p>

<p>When I was asked this question during interviews, I said, well, I enjoy coding
much more than writing papers. It is true, but the reasons are not as simple as
that.</p>

<p>Doing research is fun, and can be very rewarding.
My research is mainly scientific computing and numerical modelling.
In the past, I wrote codes to simulate the physical world, and now,
I probably have to write codes to sell more products, which does not sound very exciting.</p>

<p>To many people, leaving academia means failure. There is no need to deny that.
For me, I know this is what I want to do. The good thing is that I have the skill sets that are needed for the software development work, and luckily, I got myself a job after two months of job hunting.</p>

<p>Before starting my new job, I built this website with two purposes.</p>

<p>First of all, maintaining a website is definitely a good way to learn new things and try some fun stuff.
Secondly, I believe writing is still a critical skill even though I donâ€™t need to write journal papers, and blogging is the best way of practising it. It is quite different from academic writing though.</p>

<p>Approaching the end of 2020, I do not know what life will bring me ahead,
but I am happy that I made this decision, and I look forward to the new chapter.</p>
