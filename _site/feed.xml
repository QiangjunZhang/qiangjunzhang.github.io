software engineer after finishing my PhD and a short RA experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research topic is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scientific computing&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;numerical modelling&lt;/code&gt;, so in the past I
wrote codes to simulate the physical world, and now, I will write codes to sell more
products, which sounds much less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing research is fun, and sometimes very rewarding, but sometimes it can be
extremely frustrating. Personally, I enjoy writing codes much more than writing
papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this special year, when we all are in lockdown caused by Covid 19,
I finally made my mind, and got myself a software engineer job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, it makes sense to have my own website, and that
is why you end up here. Maintaining a website is a good way to try some new stuff,
and the benefits of blogging are undoubtedly huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon in my next post!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Qiangjun Zhang</name><email>zhangqj616@gmail.com</email></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">At the age of 30, I made a decision to change my career and become a full time software engineer after finishing my PhD and a short RA experience.</summary></entry></feed>
