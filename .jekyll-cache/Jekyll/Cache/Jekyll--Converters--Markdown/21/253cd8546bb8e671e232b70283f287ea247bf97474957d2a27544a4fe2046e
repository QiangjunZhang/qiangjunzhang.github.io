I"$<p>At the age of 30, I made a decision to change my career and become a full time
software engineer after finishing my PhD and a short RA experience.</p>

<p>My research topic is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scientific computing</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numerical modelling</code>, so in the past I
wrote codes to simulate the physical world, and now, I will write codes to sell more
products, which sounds much less interesting.</p>

<p>Doing research is fun, and sometimes very rewarding, but sometimes it can be
extremely frustrating. Personally, I enjoy writing codes much more than writing
papers.</p>

<p>In this special year, when we all are in lockdown caused by Covid 19,
I finally made my mind, and got myself a software engineer job.</p>

<p>As a software engineer, it makes sense to have my own website, and that
is why you end up here. Maintaining a website is a good way to try some new stuff,
and the benefits of blogging are undoubtedly huge.</p>

<p>See you soon in my next post!</p>
