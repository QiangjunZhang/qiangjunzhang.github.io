In this special year, when we are all stuck at home during Coronavirus lockdown,
I finally made my mind, and decided to pursue a career as a software engineer.

It is not an easy decision for me.
After spent so many years in academia and earned a PhD in engineering,
everyone thought I will stay in academia and find a job in an University somewhere.
No doubt, it was difficult to explain to my friends why I made this decision,
actually many of them were shocked.

When I was asked this question during interviews, I said, well, I enjoy coding
much more than writing papers. It is true, but the reasons are not as simple as
that.

Doing research is fun, and can be very rewarding.
My research is mainly scientific computing and numerical modelling.
In the past, I wrote codes to simulate the physical world, and now,
I probably have to write codes to sell more products, which does not sound very exciting.

To many people, leaving academia means failure. There is no need to deny that.
For me, I know this is what I want to do. The good thing is that I have the skill sets that are needed for the software development work, and luckily, I got myself a job after two months of job hunting.

Before starting my new job, I built this website with two purposes.

First of all, maintaining a website is definitely a good way to learn new things and try some fun stuff.
Secondly, I believe writing is still a critical skill even though I don't need to write journal papers, and blogging is the best way of practising it. It is quite different from academic writing though.

Approaching the end of 2020, I do not know what life will bring me ahead,
but I am happy that I made this decision, and I look forward to the new chapter.
