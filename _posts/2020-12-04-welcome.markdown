At the age of 30, I made a decision to change my career and become a full time
software engineer after finishing my PhD and a short RA experience.

My research topic is `scientific computing` and `numerical modelling`, so in the past I
wrote codes to simulate the physical world, and from now on, I will write codes for
the person called `product manager`, which sounds much less interesting.

Doing research is fun, and sometimes very rewarding, but sometimes it can be
extremely frustrating. Personally, I enjoy writing codes much more than writing
papers. 

In this special year, when we all are in lockdown caused by Covid 19,
I finally made my mind, and got myself a software engineer job.

As a software engineer, it makes sense to have my own website, and that
is why you end up here.

Maintaining a website is a good way to try some new stuff,
and the benefits of blogging are undoubtedly huge.

See you soon in my next post!
